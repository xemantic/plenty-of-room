## 2026-08-12 — Iteration 1

### Interaction with Kazik

**Kazik, opening instruction (paraphrased in full, this is the founding brief):**

> The purpose of this project is to fulfil `third-party/2026-08-ndi-gen1-problem-definition.md`.
> It is up to you how to structure this repository to provide the result.
> Running as root on this VPS — install any software without asking permission.
> If an experiment needs more CPU/GPU/MEM than the box has, **stop the loop and ask for assistance.**
> `git@github.com:NanoDynamicsInst/simulation-task-map.git` is cloned at `../simulation-task-map` for inspection.
> On each concluded iteration, commit and push immediately.
> Maintain a journal tracking every interaction, key decisions, and progress.
> Any software created on behalf of the project stays in the project, for re-use and inspection.
> **Use TDD — always write tests before the implementation.**
> Maintain a task queue, and **prioritise process blockers over low-hanging fruit** (override the default ROI orientation).
> The project offers TDD and numeric support in Kotlin; multiple `main` entry points are fine.
> Not bound to any particular technology — use the best tool for each problem.
> Start by creating `SESSION-PROMPT.md`, which can later be started with
> `/loop read @SESSION-PROMPT.md and follow the instructions in it`.

No questions were put back to Kazik this iteration; nothing was blocking.

### Decisions

**D-1. The repository is organised around the GPD loop, not around the code.**
`gpd/tasks/` (Formulate + Plan), `gpd/results/` (machine-readable), `gpd/claims/` (verified, with provenance),
`gpd/challenges/` (contradiction raises a challenge, never an overwrite). The Kotlin sources are an
implementation detail underneath that. Rationale: NDI's §5 and §7 are explicit that the *process* is what is
being evaluated, so the process has to be the visible structure of the repository, not a thing inferred from it.

**D-2. Task IDs are ours (`T-*`, `P-*`) but every one carries the NDI leaf ID it traces to.**
`../simulation-task-map/AGENTS.md` requires citing leaf IDs rather than prose paraphrases. Our own `P-*`
process tasks have no leaf and say so.

**D-3. `kotlinx-serialization` added rather than hand-rolling JSON.**
Every task has to emit machine-readable results, so the emitter is used eight or more times.
Consistent with the CLAUDE.md standing warning against hand-rolled implementations of things libraries do.
Verified to resolve before any code depended on it.

**D-4. A generic `study` Gradle task instead of competing for the single `application` main class.**
`./gradlew study -Pstudy=brush.BrushStiffnessStudyKt`. Each GPD task adds its own entry point.

**D-5. Results are emitted to a fixed filename, with no timestamp.**
A re-run that changes nothing produces no git diff; a re-run that changes something produces a reviewable one.
This is worth more than run-history in the filename, which git already provides.

**D-6. Task 8 (tile positional variance) promoted above its numbering.**
It is nearly free once T-1 exists, and it is a *falsifier*: a layer compliant enough to actuate may be too
compliant to hold position at 300 K. Cheap falsifiers before expensive confirmations.

**D-7. `P-3` (PEG material parameter sheet) and `P-4` (volume-fraction bookkeeping) raised as process
blockers, not as follow-ups.** §2 of the problem definition says outright that where the semidilute crossover
sits *decides which exponent we are entitled to*. T-1 discharges this by carrying all three exponents and
reporting the spread, which is honest but is not the same as answering it.

**D-8. The de Gennes wall mapping was derived rather than looked up.**
§2 names the asymmetric geometry as a source of prefactor confusion. Resolved by the mirror-plane argument:
an impenetrable wall imposes the same boundary condition as the midplane between two non-interpenetrating
brushes, so `D → 2h` and the factor of two cancels from both ratios. The circulating error is keeping the 2
while reinterpreting `D`, which understates the pressure by `2^(9/4) ≈ 4.76`.

**D-9. The MWC form was derived rather than cited, because the cited version could not be trusted.**
§2 names MWC as a third circulating form that "does not reduce to the same thing". Rather than reproduce a
half-remembered closed form, it was rebuilt from the parabolic self-consistent potential plus the mean-field
contact-value theorem `P = ½ w k_BT n(h)²`. This turned out to be the right call — see below.

### Progress

- `P-1` (loop skeleton) — **done**. `SESSION-PROMPT.md`, `JOURNAL.md`, `TASKS.md`, `gpd/`.
- `P-2` (locked units + result emitter) — **done**. `Physics.kt`, and the `StudyResult` envelope that logs
  every parameter alongside units, conventions and validity.
- `T-1` (stiffness of the polymer layer, leaf `A2.1`) — **done, verified, filed as `C-0001`**.
- 75 tests, all green, written before their implementations. All five verification gates are executed
  as tests and named for the gate they discharge.

### What was surprising

**S-1. The SCF brush has *zero* stiffness at first contact.**
The scaling form's pressure vanishes linearly at `L₀`, the SCF form's vanishes quadratically, because the
SCF brush has a diffuse outer edge. Consequence: **"the stiffness of the polymer layer" is not a well-posed
single number at the resting height** — it is only well-posed at a stated compression. This was not
anticipated and it changes how every downstream task has to quote a stiffness. It is also a concrete
instance of exactly what §2 warned about, arrived at independently.

**S-2. The de Gennes and MWC heights agree at `w = π²a³/4`, independent of `N` and `σ`.**
That the calibration is a pure number was not expected, and it is what makes the two forms comparable:
with it, any residual difference in the compression curves is functional form rather than prefactor.

**S-3. The equilibrium stiffness scales as `σ^(7/6)`, not `σ^(3/2)`.**
`k/A = 3k_BT σ^(3/2)/L₀` looks like a 3/2 law until one notices `L₀` carries `σ^(1/3)` too.
Easy to get wrong, so it is pinned by a test.

**S-4. The mechanical window is empty at 5 nm and 7 nm.**
The headline result, and sharper than expected: at the §3 target force, the brush-regime window with ≥ 3 nm
stroke is empty at two of the three specified layer heights, and narrow at the third. The ~10 nm desired
stroke is unreachable anywhere in the brush regime. All four models agree in direction; they disagree by
about 1.5× in magnitude. §4(b) asked whether there is a reason to go outside 5–10 nm — the answer, from the
mechanics alone, is yes, and the direction is **thicker**.

**S-5. The semidilute premise survives contact with our own layer.**
Working volume fraction across the surviving window is φ ≈ 0.03–0.044, roughly five times below the
conventional semidilute→concentrated crossover. So the `9/4` exponent is one we *are* entitled to here —
which is a checked premise rather than an inherited one, and it is the first of §2's caveats to actually close.

### Next

`T-2` — the feasible design window. T-1 hands it a sharp starting point rather than a blank sweep:
a single narrow band at `L₀ = 10 nm`, already bounded by two constraints, before §4(c) and §4(d) touch it.
`P-3` runs before or alongside, because it is now the binding premise under both.
